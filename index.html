    <h1>Exploring P5.js</h1>
    <p>Intro paragraph
    self-learning about rendering graphics
    trying to get familiar with teh fundamentals (learn)
    exploration of sepecific tool called p5
    (link to p5,js.org) all of the code can be found at github.com/bla</p>
    <h2>Simple Shape</h2>
    <div id="shape">
      <p>i started with drawing basic shaped to learn how p5 works -- builig blocks for more comlpex things</p>
    </div>
    <h2>The Grid</h2>
    <div id="grid">
      <p>one idea was to move toward buidlling maze- like structures, so i rendered a grid of different colored squares -- in this case, we are rendering the grid from a 2 dimensionla array and drawing the squares randomly over the grid</p>
      <button id = "grid_button" onclick = "var p5_grid = new p5(grid_sketch, 'grid'); document.getElementById('grid_button').remove()">Click to start</button>
    </div>
    <h2>Adding Rules</h2>
    <div id="rules">
      <p>CLICK TO REDRAW I wanted to build a more complex algorithm for creating a solvable maze and to decide whether a specific square would be light otr dark and built a path tthrough a maze. i tried sevrl combinations to make sure that teh white squares dont clump</p>
      <button id = "rules_button" onclick = "var p5_rules = new p5(rules_sketch, 'rules'); document.getElementById('rules_button').remove()">Click to start</button>
    </div>
    <h2>The Snake</h2>
    <div id="snake">
      <p>CLICK TO REDRAW in order to make a more realistic path, i changed the perspective to have a current sqaure, then set rules for where the next square will be, fillling in the square each time. i also explored color and how each sqaure can have its own changin goclor</p>
      <button id = "snake_button" onclick = "var p5_snake = new p5(snake_sketch, 'snake'); document.getElementById('snake_button').remove()">Click to start</button>
    </div>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>thers many ideads about where this could go. 1) using input from some kinda of data set to choose how to draw these -- as of right no, most of data is randoml ygenerated but it could come from external data such as number of mcdonlads in teh world. 2) toward more generative art such as: mazes, maps, landscape drawings, and just art.</p>
    <p>looking foward tyo BKLbh;a wto learn how to do more of this and see hwo other peole use it.</p>
